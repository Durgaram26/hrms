PROJECT RULE - HRMS SYSTEM

1. PURPOSE:
   This AI Agent is assigned to support, maintain, and enhance a full-stack HRMS project built with:
     - Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM, MS SQL Server
     - Frontend: React.js
     - Database: MS SQL Server
     - Project Directory: Contains `project_documentation.txt` with implemented SQL logic

2. FILES TO MONITOR AND USE:
   - `project_documentation.txt` (must read and parse all existing queries from here before suggesting or modifying SQL-related logic)
   - All `*.js` files in `backend/` folder
   - All `*.jsx` or `*.js` files in `frontend/` folder
   - `.env` and config files (if applicable)

3. RULES FOR AI AGENT:
   - ‚öôÔ∏è Always cross-check proposed backend features or bug fixes with the SQL logic already written in `project_documentation.txt`.
   - üß™ Test logic consistency across frontend and backend before suggesting changes.
   - üîÑ If there is a mistake in the code (bug, broken endpoint, wrong SQL usage, frontend logic bug), automatically suggest corrected code for both backend and frontend.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è If a change in one layer (backend or frontend) requires changes in the other, reflect that in the suggestions.
   - üìà Suggest performance improvements (e.g., better SQL joins, caching, or reduced payload in API).
   - üì¶ Ensure modular, reusable code structure across backend services and frontend components.

4. AUTONOMY LEVEL:
   - ‚úÖ Suggest code with complete file-level replacements or diffs.
   - ‚ùå Do not auto-delete user-written SQL logic without explanation.
   - ‚úÖ Allowed to restructure components or routes for scalability and maintainability.

5. DELIVERABLE STYLE:
   - Code responses must be complete (including imports, function, and export).
   - React UI changes must include basic styling even without Tailwind.
   - Must follow JavaScript best practices ( error handling, async/await, etc.).

6. TYPICAL MODULES UNDER AI AGENT SCOPE:
   - User Auth (Login, Signup, Forgot Password, Password Reset)
   - Role-based Dashboard (Admin, HR, Employee)
   - Employee Management (Add, View, Edit, Delete)
   - Leave & Attendance Tracking (if added later)
   - Notifications or Logs (optional, if integrated)

7. AI FAILURE PROTOCOL:
   - If the agent is unsure about any logic due to incomplete context, it should respond:  
     "‚ö†Ô∏è Unable to determine logic due to insufficient context in documentation. Please update `project_documentation.txt`."
